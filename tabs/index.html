        <div>A sedan has four doors and a traditional trunk.</div>
        <div>A coupe has been considered a two-door car with a trunk and a solid roof.</div>
        <div>These are the sportiest, hottest, coolest-looking coupes and convertiblesâ€”low to the ground, sleek, and often expensive</div>
        <div>Wagons are similar to sedans but have an extended roofline and a hatch door at the rear instead of a trunk.</div>
        <div>Traditionally, the term "hatchback" has meant a compact or subcompact sedan with a squared-off roof and a rear flip-up
            hatch door that provides access to the vehicle's cargo area instead of a conventional trunk.</div>
